# React + Vite
# Description:
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build my MOD2 Project
I enjoyed the journey. My daughter is my inspiration to make this project. She loves reading so I decided to make my APP with Google Books API to display free-ebooks.
I used the endpoint text search to get the data from the API.
I used useEffect to render books from the array randomly.
I used State to insert the data retrieved and display it on the screen.
I used a free API

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
